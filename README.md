# ParkScores
Analysis of San Francisco Park Scores

Purpose:
Thoughout San Francisco there are more than 200 parks. Each park in the city is given a certain rating that indicates the condition of the park. By analyzing the surrounding factors of the neighborhood a park is located in, a correlation can be identified between parks scores and the quality of the facilities in surrounding areas.

Data:
Downloaded and analyzed different kinds of data sets which included one for park scores, one for evictions, and one for crimes. All of these sets were found on datasf.org

Also wanted to find a correlation between park scores and the reputation/rank of schools located in the same area.
There was no downloadable data set that could be collected to analyze and compare school ranks with parks based on location, so the data was obtained by scraping it from different websites. 
The first website that we tried to scrape from blocked the computer from accessing the website since it thought a human was not browsing on it. 
The next method was to download a list of addresses from the sf edu website of different elementary, middle, and high school in the area. After collecting the addresses, we wanted to see the neighborhood each school was located in. To do this, we used the data.sf website to find the coordinates of the address and compared it with the different neighborhoods to see which one contained that coorrdinate.
